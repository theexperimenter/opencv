# opencv
First Iteration of Classifier for detecting cars in images. 

Ran the classifier with LBP flag on opencv_traincascade 

Works well but there are still inaccuracies in detection 

Will need to train again with better images and for longer to get better results 

enter following command in terminal to test classifier

python opencv.py --image test_image.jpg
