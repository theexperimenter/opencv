# opencv

Train your own classifier using this guide:
http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html

This classifier is used to detect cars in images and videos. 

This is first Iteration of Classifier 

Ran the classifier with LBP flag on opencv_traincascade 

Works well but there are still inaccuracies in detection 

Will need to train again with better images and for longer to get better results 

enter following command in terminal to test classifier

python opencv.py --image test_image.jpg
